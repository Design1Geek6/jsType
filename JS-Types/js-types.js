// Assign the result of the string concatenation to a variable: name 
 
 
// Add two numbers together, and assign the result in a variable: calculation 
// Add a number and a string together. Store the result in a variable: unexpected 
// What happened?  Why? 

const first = 'Tyler ';
const middle = 'Jeffery ';

const name = first + middle + last;
